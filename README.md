# 🚀 zkSync Era In-Memory Node 🚀

This crate provides an in-memory node that supports forking the state from other networks.

The goal of this crate is to offer a fast solution for integration testing, bootloader and system contract testing, and
prototyping.

🔗 For a detailed walkthrough, refer to the [official documentation](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/testing/era-test-node.html).

## 📌 Overview

The In-Memory Node is designed for local testing and uses an in-memory database for storing state information. It also employs simplified hashmaps for tracking blocks and transactions. When in fork mode, it fetches missing storage data from a remote source if not available locally. Additionally, it uses the remote server (openchain) to resolve the ABI and topics to human-readable names.

## ⚠️ Caution

Please note that `era-test-node` is still in its **alpha** stage. Some features might not be fully supported yet and may not work as intended. However, it is open-sourced, and contributions are welcome!

## 📊 Limitations & Features

| 🚫 Limitations | ✅ Features |
|----------------|-------------|
| No communication between Layer 1 and Layer 2. | Can fork the state of mainnet, testnet, or custom network. |
| Many APIs are not yet implemented. | Can replay existing mainnet or testnet transactions. |
| No support for accessing historical data. | Uses local bootloader and system contracts. |
| Only one transaction allowed per Layer 1 batch. | Operates deterministically in non-fork mode. |
| Fixed values returned for zk Gas estimation. | Starts up quickly with pre-configured 'rich' accounts. |
| Redeploy requires MetaMask cache reset. | Supports hardhat's console.log debugging. |
| | Resolves names of ABI functions and Events using openchain. |

## 🛠 Prerequisites

1. **Rust**: `era-test-node` is written in Rust. Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. [Download Rust here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Other Dependencies**: This crate relies on rocksDB. If you face any compile errors due to rocksDB, install the necessary dependencies with:
   ```bash
   apt-get install -y cmake pkg-config libssl-dev clang
   ```

## 📥 Installation & Setup

1. Install `era-test-node`:
   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/matter-labs/era-test-node.git --locked
   ```
2. Start the node:
   ```bash
   era_test_node run
   ```

## 🌐 Network Details

- L2 RPC: http://localhost:8011
- Network Id: 260

> Note: The existing implementation does not support communication with Layer 1. As a result, an L1 RPC is not available.

## 🍴 Forking Networks

To fork the mainnet:
```bash
era_test_node fork mainnet
```

> Tip: You can also fork the testnet with `era_test_node fork testnet`.

## 🔄 Replay Remote Transactions Locally

If you wish to replay a remote transaction locally for deep debugging, use the following command:
```bash
era_test_node replay_tx testnet 0x7f039bcbb1490b855be37e74cf2400503ad57f51c84856362f99b0cbf1ef478a
```

## 📞 Sending Network Calls

You can send network calls against a running `era-test-node`. For example, to check the testnet LINK balance or mainnet USDT, use `curl` or `foundry-zksync`.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_call","params":[{"to":"0x40609141Db628BeEE3BfAB8034Fc2D8278D0Cc78", "data":"0x06fdde03"}, "latest"],"id":1}' http://localhost:8011
```

## 🔍 Seeing more details of the transactions

By default, the tool is just printing the basic information about the executed transactions (like status, gas used etc).

But with --show-calls flag, it can print more detailed call traces, and with --resolve-hashes, it will ask openchain for ABI names.

```bash
era_test_node --show-calls=user --resolve-hashes replay_tx testnet 0x7f039bcbb1490b855be37e74cf2400503ad57f51c84856362f99b0cbf1ef478a

## 💰 Using Rich Wallets

For testing and development purposes, the `era-test-node` comes pre-configured with a set of 'rich' wallets. These wallets are loaded with test funds, allowing you to simulate transactions and interactions without the need for real assets.

Here's a list of the available rich wallets:

| Account Address | Private Key |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `0x36615Cf349d7F6344891B1e7CA7C72883F5dc049` | `0x7726827caac94a7f9e1b160f7ea819f172f7b6f9d2a97f992c38edeab82d4110` |
| `0xa61464658AfeAf65CccaaFD3a512b69A83B77618` | `0xac1e735be8536c6534bb4f17f06f6afc73b2b5ba84ac2cfb12f7461b20c0bbe3` |

Feel free to use these wallets in your tests, but remember, they are for development purposes only and should not be used in production or with real assets.
